# My DCA Smart Contract

## Introduction

This repository contains the smart contract for the My DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) platform. The My DCA platform allows users to automate the process of investing in cryptocurrencies, specifically Ethereum (ETH) and StackN (STKN). By using this smart contract, users can deposit USD Coin (USDC) and have it automatically converted into the desired cryptocurrency at regular intervals, reducing the impact of market volatility.
