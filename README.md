# StackN DCA 

This repository contains the smart contract for the My DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) platform. The My DCA platform allows users to automate the process of investing in cryptocurrencies, specifically Ethereum (ETH). By using this smart contract, users can deposit USD Coin (USDC) and have it automatically converted into the desired Ethereum at regular intervals, reducing the impact of market volatility.

Depositing USDC on the smart contract (with an active DCA) yields StacK N tokens.
